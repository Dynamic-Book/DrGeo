Dr. Genius



Dr. Genius is about interactive geometry.  
It allows one to create geometric figures plus the interactive manipulations of such figures in respect with their geometric constraints. 
It is useable in teaching situations with students from primary or secondary level.

DrGenius (as was DrGeo) is officially part of the GNU project
