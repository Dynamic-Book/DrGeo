Help needed - Development

SCHEME/GUILE WIZARDS -- The potentialities of Guile into DrGenius are important, there are many paths to explore:
DGS macro => procedural macro written in Scheme (hot!)
Geometry proof system for DrGenius => guidance in proof (very hot!)
Scheme console, to interactively manipulate DrGenius figure from Scheme commands
Define an alternative save format in Scheme then a Logo to DrGenius translator

GNOME WIZARD
Gnome is a moving target, help is needed to integrate the beast into DrGenius
